The objective was to determine if DNA methylation which affects gene expression can be used as a biomarker to diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a recurring psychological response to traumatic events involving life threatening situations, serious injury, or death. Soldiers, doctors, and emergency workers are among those with a high risk of developing PTSD, which, in recent studies, has been suggested to have a causal association with DNA methylation, a chemical process which adds a methyl group (CH3) to cytosines in a DNA sequence. Numerous machine learning algorithms were used to build multiple models through taking significant methylated sites out of a list of 429,948 from 163 subjects containing both patient and control groups, in order to select the model with the highest accuracy of predicting PTSD. A final list of 143 sites, identified through using probability (p) values as a baseline to determine if the site itself was actually significant or not, was used as the dataset for multiple successful machine learning models. The model with the highest accuracy utilized the algorithm SVC (Support Vector Classifier), with a testing accuracy of  92.3%. This means that we can expect this model to correctly predict PTSD 92.3% of the time.  In all, as supported by the findings and research, it can be reasonably concluded that the hypothesis of the feasibility of using DNA Methylation as a biomarker to diagnose PTSD, was indeed supported
